What doesn‚Äôt vary, however, is the attack methodology. Rather than using phishing techniques, the chosen method for the vast majority of ransomware attacks these days, Ghost prefers to use publicly available code to exploit known security vulnerabilities in software and firmware that their operators have not patched. They do this to gain access to internet-facing servers and ultimately strike with the ransomware payload.', 'I‚Äôm sure the new fbi director will handle this in the most competent way possible, who is it again? ‚Ä¶checks notes‚Ä¶ oh‚Ä¶.
