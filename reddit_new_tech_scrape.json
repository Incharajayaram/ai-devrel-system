In this comment, for those interested, here\u2019s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929324001440\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nBrain connectivity deviations linked to social challenges in boys with autism\n\nDifficulties in social situations experienced by boys with autism may be related to how certain brain networks communicate with each other, a new study suggests. Scientists at the A*STAR Institute for Human Development and Potential have found that variations in the connections between brain networks involved in attention and self-reflection were associated with challenges in social awareness, communication, and understanding social cues. The research was published in Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience.\n\nThe results showed that deviations in communication patterns between certain brain networks were indeed linked to specific aspects of social behavior problems in boys with autism. Specifically, differences in connectivity involving the default mode network, ventral attention network, frontoparietal network, and somatomotor network were related to different dimensions of social difficulties.\n\nInterestingly, deviations in the communication between the ventral attention network and the default mode network were found to be particularly relevant and were associated with challenges in social awareness, social communication, and social understanding. This suggests that when these networks don\u2019t communicate in a typical way, it may impact a person\u2019s ability to understand social cues, communicate effectively, and grasp social situations.\n\nFurthermore, the study found that cognitive flexibility and working memory played a mediating role in the connection between deviations in ventral attention network and default mode network communication and social behavior problems. This means that boys with autism who had greater deviations in this brain network communication and who also had weaker cognitive flexibility and working memory skills tended to have more pronounced social difficulties. This finding suggests that these thinking skills might be a pathway through which brain connectivity differences impact social behavior in autism.",

The performance demands on each service are very different and they need to be scaled separately. \n\nIn this particular example I'm having a hard time imagining a real world scenario where a company might have separate Order, Payment, and Shipping teams unless if the company is absolutely gigantic. Most companies would just have a single Processing team that would handle all of these things. Similarly if the services are so tightly coupled together that you need a distributed transaction, their performance demands are probably similar, and they're probably just a distributed monolith.\n\nI'm not saying the Saga pattern isn't appropriate in certain circumstances, but in all likelihood it's probably not applicable to the problem you're working, and you're better off just combining all of these services into a single monolith and just using a regular transaction to rollback in case of an error.",

That\u2019s okay in many situation, but it becomes less efficient if one caller is calling from several locations. An extreme example would be someone using an edge computing platform: they could call you from 100s for different IPs. A solution could be to make which header serve as key part of the configuration, with IP as default. For example, for an authenticated call, I may want to use the Authorization header (maybe hashed to not store tokens as keys in redis).\n\n2. It won\u2019t be a problem in a lot of cases, but your token bucket implementation is not atomic. You get from redis then decrement locally then save back to redis. In a high load scenario, you could \u00ab\u00a0loose count\u00a0\u00bb of some calls.\nFor example, if you serve two calls (A then B), and if the write operations reach redis in reversed order (maybe there was a small network congestion when A sent its update). Then the result from B will be overwritten by the (outdated) one for A.\n\nYou could look into implementing the bucket directly into Redis (using Lua) to ensure it\u2019s atomic.

            "Hi all, I've just received my PhD in systems/computational neuroscience (January), and I'm applying for data science and more ML focused analyst roles, but so far I'm not having much luck getting those first round interviews.  I know the first job search is difficult so I'm looking for some cold hard facts about how employable I look on paper, and how well I fit data science/analyst roles.\n\nHere's my [resume,](https://imgur.com/a/GhBuHsR) I'm applying to both data scientist/ML roles, and analyst roles. Any advice on what to change/if this is all a big waste of time would be very welcome!",
            "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m looking to transition into data science but could really use some guidance from those who\u2019ve been through a similar journey. Here\u2019s a bit about my situation:\n\n* **Background:**\u00a0I don\u2019t have a degree in any STEM field (my background is completely unrelated), but I\u2019m currently self-studying Python with a focus on data science-related topics (e.g., pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, etc.).\n* **Constraints:**\u00a0I\u2019m beyond the age where I can study full-time, as I have to work to support myself. This means I need to balance learning with a full-time job.\n* **Goal:**\u00a0I want to build the skills necessary to land an entry-level role in data science or a related field (e.g., data analysis).\n\nI\u2019d love to hear from anyone who\u2019s made a similar transition, especially those without a traditional STEM background. Here are some specific questions I have:\n\n1. **Learning Path:**\u00a0What topics or tools should I prioritize after Python? Should I dive into SQL, machine learning, or something else?\n2. **Portfolio:**\u00a0What kinds of projects should I work on to build a strong portfolio that showcases my skills to potential employers?\n3. **Networking:**\u00a0How did you network or find opportunities without a traditional academic background?\n4. **Job Search:**\u00a0What entry-level roles should I target initially? Are there specific industries or companies that are more open to self-taught candidates?\n5. **Time Management:**\u00a0Any tips for balancing self-study with a full-time job? How long did it take you to feel job-ready?\n\nIf you\u2019ve been in a similar situation or have any advice, I\u2019d really appreciate your insights. Thanks in advance!\n\n**TL;DR:**\u00a0Non-STEM background, self-studying Python for data science, working full-time. Looking for advice on learning paths, portfolio projects, networking, and job search strategies to transition into data science.",
            "hey,\n\nCan someone explain what to expect during the interview rounds for a Business Data Scientist position? I understand the early rounds might focus on theoretical statistics and product use cases, but I'd like more specific details, from what I've read there's no heavy algorithm or something like that. \n\nWhile I found a comprehensive thread about [Research Data Scientist interviews](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1gukca0/google_data_science_interview_prep/), I'm specifically interested in the Business Data Scientist interview process."

There's too many fires to put out that I know how to do in R, and I don't want to burn myself out trying to put out fires in a brand new language.

The concepts underlying these tools are timeless.",

At the very least, for classical statistics, it just makes sense. \n\nAlso, I find the R community pretty welcoming and engaging. Everything from posit to rOpenSci.\n\nEdit: also r package logos are miles ahead of Python. Get it together Python ;)"

            "Deepseek breakthrough is more of a business one. It effectively demonstrated that the model can be trained and maintained much cheaper than previously believed. \n\nCurrently OpenAI and other big players are losing money and trust in them was diminishing with each new billion spend on more and more questionable gains. \n\nSuddenly an obscure Chinese startup comes out and clearly demonstrates that it\u2019s possible to be profitable.",
            "Technically, it\u2019s nothing new. The techniques you\u2019re mentioning: distillation, reinforcement learning, and mixtures of experts have been at NeurIPS in various forms since at least 2023. I\u2019m afk atm so I don\u2019t have links, but google those terms and you should be able to find them.\n\nEvery LLM that you talk to naturally has been fine-tuned using human evaluated datasets on LLM outputs using reinforcement learning to mimic the human preferences. This is what we generally call reinforcement learning from human feedback. It fine tunes the model to be more conversational and is also where a lot of the safety mechanisms come in.\n\nDistillation is relevant because you can train LLMs much faster with good data, and what data is better to use than the question/answer pairs from a model with billions of dollars behind it? You or I can\u2019t do this because OpenAI would squash us pretty hard, but a Chinese company working in secret could.\n\nThe \u201ccombination\u201d of models you might be referring to as the mixture of experts, and that\u2019s not necessary true. A mixture of expert model replaces its feed forward layers with a set of (much) smaller dense feed forward layers and then a routing layer that chooses which of them to use given the input. This allows the model to run with far fewer calculations because it doesn\u2019t need to activate the GIANT feed forward layers, just a subset of its experts. This is a big reason why DeepSeek can serve the model so much more cheaply than others.\n\nAll in all, there did seem to be some innovation in terms of hardware usage and optimizing some throttled (if you believe it) GPUs, but the tech isn\u2019t necessarily new, it\u2019s just scaled up."
