He knows her just as well as I do.\u00a0\n\n\nThere were also benefits for me and our marriage. I didn't overwork myself while recovering. He checked in on my physical and mental health often.

In this comment, for those interested, here\u2019s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929324001440\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nBrain connectivity deviations linked to social challenges in boys with autism\n\nDifficulties in social situations experienced by boys with autism may be related to how certain brain networks communicate with each other, a new study suggests. Scientists at the A*STAR Institute for Human Development and Potential have found that variations in the connections between brain networks involved in attention and self-reflection were associated with challenges in social awareness, communication, and understanding social cues. The research was published in Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience.\n\nThe results showed that deviations in communication patterns between certain brain networks were indeed linked to specific aspects of social behavior problems in boys with autism. Specifically, differences in connectivity involving the default mode network, ventral attention network, frontoparietal network, and somatomotor network were related to different dimensions of social difficulties.\n\nInterestingly, deviations in the communication between the ventral attention network and the default mode network were found to be particularly relevant and were associated with challenges in social awareness, social communication, and social understanding. This suggests that when these networks don\u2019t communicate in a typical way, it may impact a person\u2019s ability to understand social cues, communicate effectively, and grasp social situations.\n\nFurthermore, the study found that cognitive flexibility and working memory played a mediating role in the connection between deviations in ventral attention network and default mode network communication and social behavior problems. This means that boys with autism who had greater deviations in this brain network communication and who also had weaker cognitive flexibility and working memory skills tended to have more pronounced social difficulties. This finding suggests that these thinking skills might be a pathway through which brain connectivity differences impact social behavior in autism.",

More specifically the complexity involved should make you ask do you really need them? Reasons you might need them are\n\n1. You have separate Order, Payments, and Shipping teams and they need to deploy their code independently.\n2. The performance demands on each service are very different and they need to be scaled separately. \n\nIn this particular example I'm having a hard time imagining a real world scenario where a company might have separate Order, Payment, and Shipping teams unless if the company is absolutely gigantic. Most companies would just have a single Processing team that would handle all of these things. Similarly if the services are so tightly coupled together that you need a distributed transaction, their performance demands are probably similar, and they're probably just a distributed monolith.\n\nI'm not saying the Saga pattern isn't appropriate in certain circumstances, but in all likelihood it's probably not applicable to the problem you're working, and you're better off just combining all of these services into a single monolith and just using a regular transaction to rollback in case of an error.",

That\u2019s okay in many situation, but it becomes less efficient if one caller is calling from several locations. An extreme example would be someone using an edge computing platform: they could call you from 100s for different IPs. A solution could be to make which header serve as key part of the configuration, with IP as default. For example, for an authenticated call, I may want to use the Authorization header (maybe hashed to not store tokens as keys in redis).\n\n2. It won\u2019t be a problem in a lot of cases, but your token bucket implementation is not atomic. You get from redis then decrement locally then save back to redis. In a high load scenario, you could \u00ab\u00a0loose count\u00a0\u00bb of some calls.\nFor example, if you serve two calls (A then B), and if the write operations reach redis in reversed order (maybe there was a small network congestion when A sent its update). Then the result from B will be overwritten by the (outdated) one for A.\n\nYou could look into implementing the bucket directly into Redis (using Lua) to ensure it\u2019s atomic. Or maybe there are off-the-shelves Redis plugin for that.",

I know the first job search is difficult so I'm looking for some cold hard facts about how employable I look on paper, and how well I fit data science/analyst roles.\n\nHere's my [resume,](https://imgur.com/a/GhBuHsR) I'm applying to both data scientist/ML roles, and analyst roles. Any advice on what to change/if this is all a big waste of time would be very welcome!",

Here\u2019s a bit about my situation:\n\n* **Background:**\u00a0I don\u2019t have a degree in any STEM field (my background is completely unrelated), but I\u2019m currently self-studying Python with a focus on data science-related topics (e.g., pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, etc.).\n* **Constraints:**\u00a0I\u2019m beyond the age where I can study full-time, as I have to work to support myself. This means I need to balance learning with a full-time job.\n* **Goal:**\u00a0I want to build the skills necessary to land an entry-level role in data science or a related field (e.g., data analysis).\n\nI\u2019d love to hear from anyone who\u2019s made a similar transition, especially those without a traditional STEM background. Here are some specific questions I have:\n\n1. **Learning Path:**\u00a0What topics or tools should I prioritize after Python? Should I dive into SQL, machine learning, or something else?\n2. **Portfolio:**\u00a0What kinds of projects should I work on to build a strong portfolio that showcases my skills to potential employers?\n3. **Networking:**\u00a0How did you network or find opportunities without a traditional academic background?\n4. **Job Search:**\u00a0What entry-level roles should I target initially? Are there specific industries or companies that are more open to self-taught candidates?\n5. **Time Management:**\u00a0Any tips for balancing self-study with a full-time job? How long did it take you to feel job-ready?\n\nIf you\u2019ve been in a similar situation or have any advice, I\u2019d really appreciate your insights. Thanks in advance!\n\n**TL;DR:**\u00a0Non-STEM background, self-studying Python for data science, working full-time.

            "Technically, it\u2019s nothing new. The techniques you\u2019re mentioning: distillation, reinforcement learning, and mixtures of experts have been at NeurIPS in various forms since at least 2023. I\u2019m afk atm so I don\u2019t have links, but google those terms and you should be able to find them.\n\nEvery LLM that you talk to naturally has been fine-tuned using human evaluated datasets on LLM outputs using reinforcement learning to mimic the human preferences. This is what we generally call reinforcement learning from human feedback. It fine tunes the model to be more conversational and is also where a lot of the safety mechanisms come in.\n\nDistillation is relevant because you can train LLMs much faster with good data, and what data is better to use than the question/answer pairs from a model with billions of dollars behind it? You or I can\u2019t do this because OpenAI would squash us pretty hard, but a Chinese company working in secret could.\n\nThe \u201ccombination\u201d of models you might be referring to as the mixture of experts, and that\u2019s not necessary true. A mixture of expert model replaces its feed forward layers with a set of (much) smaller dense feed forward layers and then a routing layer that chooses which of them to use given the input. This allows the model to run with far fewer calculations because it doesn\u2019t need to activate the GIANT feed forward layers, just a subset of its experts. This is a big reason why DeepSeek can serve the model so much more cheaply than others.\n\nAll in all, there did seem to be some innovation in terms of hardware usage and optimizing some throttled (if you believe it) GPUs, but the tech isn\u2019t necessarily new, it\u2019s just scaled up."

In this comment, for those interested, here\u2019s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929324001440\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nBrain connectivity deviations linked to social challenges in boys with autism\n\nDifficulties in social situations experienced by boys with autism may be related to how certain brain networks communicate with each other, a new study suggests. Scientists at the A*STAR Institute for Human Development and Potential have found that variations in the connections between brain networks involved in attention and self-reflection were associated with challenges in social awareness, communication, and understanding social cues. The research was published in Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience.\n\nThe results showed that deviations in communication patterns between certain brain networks were indeed linked to specific aspects of social behavior problems in boys with autism. Specifically, differences in connectivity involving the default mode network, ventral attention network, frontoparietal network, and somatomotor network were related to different dimensions of social difficulties.\n\nInterestingly, deviations in the communication between the ventral attention network and the default mode network were found to be particularly relevant and were associated with challenges in social awareness, social communication, and social understanding. This suggests that when these networks don\u2019t communicate in a typical way, it may impact a person\u2019s ability to understand social cues, communicate effectively, and grasp social situations.\n\nFurthermore, the study found that cognitive flexibility and working memory played a mediating role in the connection between deviations in ventral attention network and default mode network communication and social behavior problems. This means that boys with autism who had greater deviations in this brain network communication and who also had weaker cognitive flexibility and working memory skills tended to have more pronounced social difficulties. This finding suggests that these thinking skills might be a pathway through which brain connectivity differences impact social behavior in autism.",

But I used to become extremely nervous after eating in public that I wont have access to a bathroom, this caused a ton of anxiety and actually made me feel very sick. After improving my diet and fiber I no longer struggle with as many issues (they still happen from time to time) and as a consequence I no longer have anxiety about finding a bathroom.\n\nIBS is certainly not just in my mind and includes tons of factors, but reducing my overall anxiety has improved the way I feel physically.

            "## \"Highlights\n\n*   Plant-based compounds play a key role as adjuvants in managing inflammation and improving clinical outcomes in asthma.\n    \n*   Enhancing bioavailability is key to maximizing the therapeutic effectiveness of plant-based antioxidants.\n    \n*   Plant-based antioxidants at lower doses or short-term intervention may not impact asthma-related biomarkers.\n    \n\n## Abstract\n\nBackground\n\nAsthma is a chronic inflammatory disease and a leading cause of disability, posing a huge economic and social burden. Plant-based antioxidants have the potential to block proinflammatory pathways and protect against oxidative damage, which could improve asthma management.\n\nObjective\n\nThis review examines the role of plant-based antioxidants as adjuvant therapy on inflammatory markers and clinical outcomes of adults with asthma.\n\nMethods\n\nDigital databases, including Scopus, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Airway Group's Specialized Register of Trials, were searched. Two independent authors performed initial and full-text screening of identified papers. The criteria for study inclusion and exclusion were predefined. Two authors independently performed data extraction and risk of bias as per the PRISMA checklist.\n\nResults\n\nAfter full-text screening, nine randomized controlled trials were included in the final review. Seven of the included studies highlighted the efficacy of plant-based antioxidants in modulating the inflammatory cytokines in asthmatics. The benefits of antioxidants were also observed for improving oxidative status, lung functioning, and airway inflammatory markers. Furthermore, the overall quality of asthmatic patients\u2019 lives was improved with fewer exacerbations such as night coughs and wheezing. Despite having some limitations, the overall risk of bias was low in this review.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe review indicated that plant-based antioxidants could have adjuvant beneficial effects in the management of asthma inflammatory markers, which may help improve asthma-related clinical outcomes. However, due to the small number of study subjects, further research is required on the effect of plant-based antioxidants on asthma-inflammatory markers and clinical outcomes.\""

            "This is especially true when done intentionally as a way to address or think deeply about difficult emotions. Amazingly helpful - I\u2019ve said on occasion 5 years of therapy compressed into 5 hours (although personally more so for depression than shame/guilt).\n\nPsychedelics often seem to push issues you\u2019re dealing with to the surface, so it can be quite challenging for people not ready to deal with those emotions or aren\u2019t in an environment that allows that (such as recreational use). So don\u2019t take them at a party if you\u2019re already depressed.",
            "From the article: A [recent study](https://doi.org/10.1080/02791072.2025.2461997) in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs has shed light on a less discussed aspect of psychedelic experiences: the feelings of shame and guilt that can arise during these journeys. Researchers found that experiencing shame or guilt while using psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in magic mushrooms, is surprisingly common, affecting about two out of every three users. However, the study also offered a positive perspective, indicating that how well individuals process these difficult emotions, rather than the intensity of the feelings themselves, is linked to their wellbeing in the weeks following the experience.\n\nThe growing interest in psychedelic substances for potential therapeutic uses has largely focused on the positive outcomes and transformative experiences they can induce. However, researchers recognized that a complete understanding of psychedelics requires acknowledging the full spectrum of experiences, including the challenging ones. Historically, negative experiences, sometimes casually referred to as \u201cbad trips,\u201d have been somewhat sidelined in both public conversation and scientific exploration.\n\nScientists sought to address this gap in knowledge by specifically examining the occurrence of shame and guilt during psilocybin experiences. They were interested in understanding how often these feelings arise, what factors might predict them, and how these emotions relate to a person\u2019s overall wellbeing after using psilocybin. The researchers hypothesized that while psychedelics are sometimes thought to reduce self-focused thinking, they might also, in some cases, bring feelings of shame and guilt to the forefront. This could be due to the profound self-reflection and emotional intensity that these substances can trigger.\n\n\u201cThis work came from me witnessing firsthand the complex ways that psychedelics could affect people \u2014 who were sometimes challenged in ways they couldn\u2019t even find language to describe,\u201d said study author David Mathai, the medical director of Sattva Medicine and a clinical assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine."

This release results in higher mercury levels in the water and sediments of the Ross Sea. Elevated mercury concentrations pose risks to marine ecosystems and, through bioaccumulation, affect the broader food web, including species consumed by humans."

The team examined the insects under the microscope, documented how the two species interacted and performed a number of experiments.\n\n>The blowfly larvae bodies have evolved to\u00a0[closely resemble those of the termites](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2825%2900007-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982225000077%3Fshowall%3Dtrue), the researchers report February 10 in\u00a0*Current Biology*.

            "This is good reading for anyone thinking about breaking up functionality like this into micro services. More specifically the complexity involved should make you ask do you really need them? Reasons you might need them are\n\n1. You have separate Order, Payments, and Shipping teams and they need to deploy their code independently.\n2. The performance demands on each service are very different and they need to be scaled separately. \n\nIn this particular example I'm having a hard time imagining a real world scenario where a company might have separate Order, Payment, and Shipping teams unless if the company is absolutely gigantic. Most companies would just have a single Processing team that would handle all of these things. Similarly if the services are so tightly coupled together that you need a distributed transaction, their performance demands are probably similar, and they're probably just a distributed monolith.\n\nI'm not saying the Saga pattern isn't appropriate in certain circumstances, but in all likelihood it's probably not applicable to the problem you're working, and you're better off just combining all of these services into a single monolith and just using a regular transaction to rollback in case of an error.",

            "Good job, it\u2019s nice to see you covered different algorithms.\nLooking at the code, I have a few comments:\n\n1. you use the IP to differentiate the callers. That\u2019s okay in many situation, but it becomes less efficient if one caller is calling from several locations. An extreme example would be someone using an edge computing platform: they could call you from 100s for different IPs. A solution could be to make which header serve as key part of the configuration, with IP as default. For example, for an authenticated call, I may want to use the Authorization header (maybe hashed to not store tokens as keys in redis).\n\n2. It won\u2019t be a problem in a lot of cases, but your token bucket implementation is not atomic. You get from redis then decrement locally then save back to redis. In a high load scenario, you could \u00ab\u00a0loose count\u00a0\u00bb of some calls.\nFor example, if you serve two calls (A then B), and if the write operations reach redis in reversed order (maybe there was a small network congestion when A sent its update). Then the result from B will be overwritten by the (outdated) one for A.\n\nYou could look into implementing the bucket directly into Redis (using Lua) to ensure it\u2019s atomic. Or maybe there are off-the-shelves Redis plugin for that.",

            "I love scala, but two things are really holding it back. \n\nFirst is the extreme functional programming enthusiasts. It seems like the dregs of asshole driven development gravitate towards it. You just don't need cats, zio, etc most the time. Li haoyi's simple, great scala DSL libraries show what the language should really be.\n\nSecond, scala 3 just doesn't have great ide integration yet, and with longer compile times it makes catching evident bugs a pain.\n\nBut god damn when you write a clean scala app it looks and feels great. It's just hard to get there",
            "Both Clojure and Scala are niche languages.\n\nClojure is stable and, aside from new implementations like babashka and new tooling like the Clojure CLI, has been basically the same for almost 2 decades. IDE support is improving  but is already at a decent place. It is definitely a different programming model than more mainstream languages, but it has its place.\n\nScala keeps making massive breaking changes, has never maintained binary compatibility, and at no point in its history has had IDE support that didn't need an asterisk. Many of the features previously unique to it have been subsumed by Java and what is left (implicits, higher kinded types) seem to make code harder to read, not easier.\n\nIf you are interested in really deep functional programming go towards https://flix.dev/. It's not exactly ready for prime time but it is at least doing something meaningfully new and interesting."

            "I've worked with something I used to call \"append-only codebase\". The codebase was a huge mess and we had no tests. So team lead decided we do not refactor anything and change as little as possible because of lack of tests and risk of breaking things. But we couldn't write unit tests without refactoring because the code was untestable and it was hard to do e2e testing because of the domain. The result? Hotfix on top of hotfix on top of hotfix and velocity dropped 3x in over a year. Fix? Blame the language and gradually rewrite it 1-1 in another one (the same host)",

This means I need to balance learning with a full-time job.\n* **Goal:**\u00a0I want to build the skills necessary to land an entry-level role in data science or a related field (e.g., data analysis).\n\nI\u2019d love to hear from anyone who\u2019s made a similar transition, especially those without a traditional STEM background. Here are some specific questions I have:\n\n1. **Learning Path:**\u00a0What topics or tools should I prioritize after Python? Should I dive into SQL, machine learning, or something else?\n2. **Portfolio:**\u00a0What kinds of projects should I work on to build a strong portfolio that showcases my skills to potential employers?\n3. **Networking:**\u00a0How did you network or find opportunities without a traditional academic background?\n4. **Job Search:**\u00a0What entry-level roles should I target initially? Are there specific industries or companies that are more open to self-taught candidates?\n5. **Time Management:**\u00a0Any tips for balancing self-study with a full-time job? How long did it take you to feel job-ready?\n\nIf you\u2019ve been in a similar situation or have any advice, I\u2019d really appreciate your insights. Thanks in advance!\n\n**TL;DR:**\u00a0Non-STEM background, self-studying Python for data science, working full-time.

            "Technically, it\u2019s nothing new. The techniques you\u2019re mentioning: distillation, reinforcement learning, and mixtures of experts have been at NeurIPS in various forms since at least 2023. I\u2019m afk atm so I don\u2019t have links, but google those terms and you should be able to find them.\n\nEvery LLM that you talk to naturally has been fine-tuned using human evaluated datasets on LLM outputs using reinforcement learning to mimic the human preferences. This is what we generally call reinforcement learning from human feedback. It fine tunes the model to be more conversational and is also where a lot of the safety mechanisms come in.\n\nDistillation is relevant because you can train LLMs much faster with good data, and what data is better to use than the question/answer pairs from a model with billions of dollars behind it? You or I can\u2019t do this because OpenAI would squash us pretty hard, but a Chinese company working in secret could.\n\nThe \u201ccombination\u201d of models you might be referring to as the mixture of experts, and that\u2019s not necessary true. A mixture of expert model replaces its feed forward layers with a set of (much) smaller dense feed forward layers and then a routing layer that chooses which of them to use given the input. This allows the model to run with far fewer calculations because it doesn\u2019t need to activate the GIANT feed forward layers, just a subset of its experts. This is a big reason why DeepSeek can serve the model so much more cheaply than others.\n\nAll in all, there did seem to be some innovation in terms of hardware usage and optimizing some throttled (if you believe it) GPUs, but the tech isn\u2019t necessarily new, it\u2019s just scaled up."

Many many problems require minimal or no language to solve. There are so many possible approaches to these problems that haven't yet been tapped.\n\nA few years ago the hype was around AlphaGo and their other game-playing AIs for example. Those had very little to do with LLMs, but it's a very interesting problem space with a lot to teach us.\n\nGenerating language is a fairly expensive operation for businesses, so it's a potentially profitable endeavour for companies to create and sell those models. That's why we're seeing so much hype, because it's finally a saleable product instead of a toy.\n\nBut as you note, while many tasks can be framed in terms of language, it's not computationally or operationally efficient to do so a lot of the time. One of the constraints on domain-specific models is that they need to fit inside the budget.",

Some CEOs and entrepreneurs whose job it is to hype up their products?\n\nAI progress is a bunch of small teams of people spread across hundreds of institutions, sometimes working together, sometimes working against or in competition with each other, often siloed. Moreover, they don't decide what is going to happen, they follow their research where it leads them in the hope that they can make any type of progress at all enough to publish a paper.\n\nThere is no global AI initiative or team or unified vision. AI isn't supposed to or supposed to not do anything, it's a bunch of mostly uncoordinated people doing their own thing. The only AI narrative is talking points from media and business people, and besides the fact that even that is not unified or coherent, you'd think that people on a sub like this would know better."

I've been in both sides as a candidate and interviewer.\n\n  \n**\\[1\\] Role -** First of all, you want to find the right focus on which data / ML roles you are pursuing. Given that this defines the interview process; thereby your preparation.\n\n1. Data Analytics / Product Data Science - This role requires statistical analysis, lots of SQL + Pandas, A/B testing and modeling.\n\n2. Full Stack Data Science - It's like product DS, but instead of A/B testing, more focus on machine learning, model deployment. In some cases, this role may be could ML Ops engineer, less to do with the actual development but more on the deployment and tracking.\n\n3. LLM / ML Engineering - This branches into two avenues. One is more traditional ML engineering role which is recommender system. LLM engineering (or \"AI engineering\" which is just a rebrand). Regardless, the content you need to understand are LeetCode style coding (e.g. dynamic programming, Queues & Stacks), ML coding (with Tensorflow or Torch), software system design (E.g. Cap Theorem) and ML system design (e.g. designing a scalable Recommender System, or ChatGPT clone).\n\n**\\[2\\] Preparation -** Having said that, agnostic of the roles, there are base fundamentals you need to know across these roles. So, if you are still not sure which specialization to pursue, I would recommend start with these:\n\n1. Start by reviewing the fundamentals in data & ML roles as seen in this [100 Key Concepts to Know in Data Science Interview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gqPgNLtB1m4833jrP6k15JQNjH8YNlxGzbJoVcUtf0/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n2. Watch mock interviews like this one [Facebook Data Scientist Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MWOXXLxSb4&lc=UgwiGrKC38jnpZ9u62F4AaABAg) that gives you an idea about how interviews are actually conducted in top tier companies like Google, Facebook and such.\n\n3. Start doing SQL drills on datainterview. There's a free SQL course with real-world product data as seen on [Product SQL Course](https://www.datainterview.com/courses/sql).\n\n\\---\n\n  \nHappy to help so if you have any questions, feel free to ask away for more!",

You can write a paragraph, do a bulleted list of key things like models run, functions created, whatever helps you organize relevant information for future use. Again, think about how you remember things or what you look for to find a project and make descriptions that are useful to that goal. If you want something a little more fancy you can use something like Obsidian. Personally I like to organize by project folder and will document the contents of the folder in a single note.\n\nIt is going to suck to make this document. You will not want to update it, you will feel like it's a waste of time, you will feel like you'll remember that really important thing later, do it anyway. Just like good documentation, it will save you a ton of time in the long run even if it sucks for present you. The bonus of doing a document based system in the age of AI is you can always feed it into an llm and ask it questions about your projects too.",
            "I've been looking for some kind of first principles/fundamental best practice for repo design for years. The best consultants haven't been able to give a firm answer. It's always \"by project\" or \"whatever works for your team\". I'm not a traditional SDLC guy and they didn't teach anything remotely close to repo design in my DS master's program from a really good school. I'm convinced this wisdom is out there some where, but I haven't found it yet either."

There are millions of ways that data can vary, and basically none of them correspond to the axes that are indicative of fraud. You can choose a few good variables, normalise your data and then you'll get a decent oddness detector. But this will just get you odd and unusual transactions, not fraudulent ones. You need good labels and you need great data. The more data you can connect on to the customer and counterparty, the better. Basic lookbacks on the customer and counterparty's transaction history (if the latter is available),\u00a0network features, etc, etc. Once you have a good labels and great data you can just run a basic gradient boosting machine on it and it will probably work pretty well, especially with some hyperparameter tuning.",

For example, a customer satisfaction survey of 500 customers can give you a good idea of the opinions of your user base as a whole without needing to collect responses from everyone, assuming your sample is representative. \n\nAlong what you were thinking, you can also use techniques such as hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and confidence intervals to predict trends, assess risks, and measure the impact of strategic changes. The goal of these efforts is more efficient operations and better strategic planning. For example: should a business open a new location at a location given its proximity of existing locations, competitors, and customers? That sort of thing.\n\nIMHO, to be successful in the role of data analyst, you need some general business acumen or other subject matter expertise. In addition to subject matter expertise and technical skills, communication skills are essential, including visualization of data.",
