Acetaminophen is such a common OTC drug that it would be hard to find pregnant women who would NOT take acetaminophen for pain during pregnancy. And if so, what do we prescribe or let them take for pain?\n\nAnother thing to point out is that there is absolutely zero data on how much acetaminophen (even if it followed minimum usage guidelines given today!) was used during pregnancy. I'm also one to note that the sample size, while big (307), was not really diverse and composed of one ethnicity only.

Also, hi, yes, I have ADHD.", "While this study isn\u2019t causal, it\u2019s does not stand alone in a 100+ year body of correlated research demonstrating great risk potential to pregnant women whose capacity to deal with the detoxification is reduced.\n\nBeyond acute toxicity, recent research has raised alarms about acetaminophen\u2019s potential impact on the developing brain and other systems in fetuses and young children. The drug readily crosses the placenta and the blood-brain barrier \ufffc, which means that when a pregnant woman or an infant takes acetaminophen, it can reach the baby\u2019s developing organs. Scientists have been examining whether this common painkiller, while relieving fevers or discomfort, might subtly interfere with neurodevelopment or other developmental processes.\n\nOne of the most discussed concerns is a possible link between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Several observational studies in the last decade have suggested an association. For example, an NIH-funded birth cohort study (published in JAMA Psychiatry in 2019) measured acetaminophen metabolites in newborns\u2019 umbilical cord blood. The children were followed for about 8\u20139 years. The results showed a dose-response relationship: children with the highest levels of acetaminophen exposure at birth had approximately 2.9 times the risk of ADHD and 3.6 times the risk of ASD compared to those with the lowest exposure \ufffc. Even those with moderate exposure had about a 2.2-fold higher risk of ADHD, indicating a trend where greater in-utero exposure correlated with higher odds of later diagnosis \ufffc. The authors noted that these findings support earlier studies that also reported links between prenatal acetaminophen use and developmental problems, and they urged further research \ufffc.\n\nWhile such studies cannot prove causation on their own (there could be confounding factors, since women who take frequent acetaminophen might have underlying conditions or infections that themselves affect development), the consistency of results across multiple studies has prompted many experts to take this issue seriously. In 2021, a large coalition of scientists and clinicians published a consensus statement in Nature Reviews Endocrinology calling for prudence in acetaminophen use during pregnancy \ufffc. Ninety-one experts from around the world signed this warning, citing a \u201cgrowing body of research\u201d suggesting acetaminophen might alter fetal development\n\nhttps://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/scientific-team-including-ysph-researcher-warn-against-use-of-acetaminophen-by-pregnant-women/#:~:text=The%20consensus%20statement%2C%20which%20was,over%20the%20past%20several%20years\n\nhttps://radiopaedia.org/articles/paracetamol?lang=us#:~:text=NAPQI%20is%20the%20mediator%20of,2\n\nhttps://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-funded-study-suggests-acetaminophen-exposure-pregnancy-linked-higher-risk-adhd-autism#:~:text=collected%20umbilical%20cord%20blood%20from,62%20times\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/ije/article/45/2/512/2572607", "Well, damn.

Researchers found that experiencing shame or guilt while using psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in magic mushrooms, is surprisingly common, affecting about two out of every three users. However, the study also offered a positive perspective, indicating that how well individuals process these difficult emotions, rather than the intensity of the feelings themselves, is linked to their wellbeing in the weeks following the experience.\n\nThe growing interest in psychedelic substances for potential therapeutic uses has largely focused on the positive outcomes and transformative experiences they can induce. However, researchers recognized that a complete understanding of psychedelics requires acknowledging the full spectrum of experiences, including the challenging ones. Historically, negative experiences, sometimes casually referred to as \u201cbad trips,\u201d have been somewhat sidelined in both public conversation and scientific exploration.\n\nScientists sought to address this gap in knowledge by specifically examining the occurrence of shame and guilt during psilocybin experiences. They were interested in understanding how often these feelings arise, what factors might predict them, and how these emotions relate to a person\u2019s overall wellbeing after using psilocybin. The researchers hypothesized that while psychedelics are sometimes thought to reduce self-focused thinking, they might also, in some cases, bring feelings of shame and guilt to the forefront. This could be due to the profound self-reflection and emotional intensity that these substances can trigger.\n\n\u201cThis work came from me witnessing firsthand the complex ways that psychedelics could affect people \u2014 who were sometimes challenged in ways they couldn\u2019t even find language to describe,\u201d said study author David Mathai, the medical director of Sattva Medicine and a clinical assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine.", "I thought I'd actually died during my first trip.

I've been trying to break into DS with an undergrad in mechanical engineering for quite some time to no avail. I chose the informal education route and was under the impression that if I can showcase my skills in the projects I do in my github, I'd have an edge against masters graduates. So, I've read dozens of books about DS and ML and did several projects. I tried to read at least 2-3 books on each subject and combine all that info to build a strong portfolio. But now I feel like they don't even look at github and to be honest I don't even know what they want in applicants.\n\nI was planning on enrolling in a 1 year program in the US as an international student as a last resort but the market is pretty bad there for data scientists (I've read most of the threads about DS job market). Interviews have gotten longer and harder and generalist data science grads are at a disadvantage apparently. The university I was planning on applying has a data engineering concentration in addition to data science courses that allows you to take 3 courses about data engineering, so it's a good program.\n\nMasters in DS in EU isn't possible as all the decent universities there want a computer science undergrad education. Also, Trump made or is likely to make hiring OPT and H1B holders harder for employers (like he did before) by making paperwork more expensive, making us more expensive to hire, and through other means.\n\nSo, I'm really not sure whether to give a career in data science another shot one more year by learning more, doing more projects, contacting recruiters and other good practices recommended in youtube videos instead of blindly applying to jobs. I can also wait about a year while learning more and doing projects and see how Trump administration will go about us international students and then maybe enroll in a 1 year long program with tons more knowledge and a stronger github profile which will increase my chances of landing a job there.\n\nMy other option is to simply give up on data science and enroll in a robotics masters in the EU.\n\nI'd greatly appreciate it if someone could offer advice!", "Hi r/datascience,\n\nI\u2019m looking to transition from data-heavy operations role in D2C retail into a more data science-focused role.\u00a0I am\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Background:**\n\n* 10+ years in demand forecasting, predictive modeling, and analytics\n* master\u2019s degree in econometrics, bachelor\u2019s in economics\n* Led an operations team at a high-growth startup, scaling revenue 10x\n* Strong SQL & Python skills (regression, time series forecasting), experience in SAS, R\n* Experience implementing AI/ML forecasting solutions\n* Built analytics tools and dashboards (Looker, Tableau)\n* Worked closely with execs and data teams to drive insights and improve feature engineering\n\n**Goal:**  \nI want to move into a data science role in predictive modeling, forecasting, or consumer analytics.
